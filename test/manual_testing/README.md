# Programs for Manual Testing

The programs in this directory support manual testing of the interpreter.
To run the test programs.

1. Run `Emulator.py`, the emulator main program.
2. Load the test program with the `assemble` command.
3. Follow the procedure outlined in the test program.

By (completely arbitrary, turn of the moment) convention, program files
end in `.160A`, as in `TestProgram.160A`.
