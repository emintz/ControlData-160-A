Micro-instructions are low level operations, typically, but not
necessarily data movement, that can be assembled into instructions
and non-instruction operations like interrupt and buffered I/O handlers.
Note that the operand address and bank must be selected before
a micro-instruction can be run.

Note that [ ... ] means "address specified by the contents of", so
[S] indicates the address contained in the S register. Registers
are specified by capital letters.

A full address specification requires both an address and a bank. Banks
are represented by lower case letters, b for Buffer, d for Direct,
i for Indirect, and r for relative.

The full specification has the form [<register>](<bank>), as in
[S](r)

TODO(emintz): compatibility with Instructions.py refactoring, if come.
