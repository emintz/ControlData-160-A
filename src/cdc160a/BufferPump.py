    Base class for buffered I/O implementations: provides an API for pumping data
    from a source to memory, and pumping data from memory into a sink. The source
    or sink is typically, but not necessarily, a peripheral device.

    Buffer pumps come in two versions: input, and output. Input pumps take
    data from their associated device and pump them into memory, while
    output pumps take data from memory and pump them into their
    associated device. Input-only or output-only devices card readers will have
    a single input or output (respectfully) pump, while input and output-capable
    devices like tape drives will have one of each.

    Buffer pumps only move data. They do not manage other machine state.

    Note that the BufferPump class does not reference the Storage class
    to sidestep circular references in subclasses. If the BufferPump
    bound a Storage instance, circular references would occur.

    Buffer pumps are intended for single use, to be created at the start
    of a buffered read or write and discarded when the operation has
    completed.
