The following functions calculate a decoded instructions effective address
and places it in the S register. This serves two purposes:
    1. Should the machine halt, the S register will contain the
       next address to be accessed. The reference manual appears to
       indicate that this is the desired behavior, though this could
       be open to interpretation.
    2. It relieves the instruction from the burden of determining its
       effective address, thus simplifying the logic and reusing
       code in this module.

Note that the instruction must be moved to the F and E registers
before any of the following are invoked.
