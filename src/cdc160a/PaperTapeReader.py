    """
    Emulates the CDC 350 Paper Tape Reader, which can read 5, 7, and 8 level
    paper tape at 350 characters per second, which makes the read delay
    approximately 446 6.4 microsecond cycles.

    Paper tape read is restricted to the normal I/O channel. The reader
    cannot buffer.

    The reader emulator takes input from text files having a single octal
    input value per line. Input values are constrained input format:

    Level       Values
    -----       ------------
        5       0 .. 2^5 - 1, i.e. [0 .. 0o37]
        7       0 .. 2^7 - 1, i.e. [0 .. 0o177]
        8       0 .. 2^8 - 1, i.e. [0 .. 0o377]

    The file format does not distinguish between physical tape formats.
    The reader reads, validates, converts, and returns the values in the
    file.

    It is recommended that paper tape data files have the extension ptape,
    papertape, paper-tape, or something similar to distinguish them from
    other text files.
